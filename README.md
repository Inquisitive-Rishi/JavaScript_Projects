My first ever JS project: ROCK PAPER SCISSOR

This UI based app lets you play the game of Rock Paper Scissor.

The game works like this:

This game is b/w user and machine.

User clicks one button (i.e either rock, paper or scissor) with appropriate icon provided followed by simultaneous AI choice.

each click plays a single round and depending on the winner the score gets updated(increased).

if either of the player (user/AI) score reaches 5, that player is declared a winner.

the game declares final winner with the appropriate message along with a reset button to restart the game.

HAPPY GAMING!


note: final touches such as sounds or overlay message will be added later on.
